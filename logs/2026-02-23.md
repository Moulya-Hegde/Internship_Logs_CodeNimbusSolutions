## What I did
- -> Fixed the template wed5 as per the new design( joining component between wishes and schedule section)
- -> Made the joining mobile responsive including swans,fence and grass.
- -> Made the schedule section work based on the new schema,along with ensuring peoper design alignment.
- -> Created routing for 'player' project based on deployment conditions so that it works by just having a slug and domain.(change this before deployment to use origin instead of pathname)
- -> Included the new css files in main page as inline styles for editor access.

## Challenges
- -> Mobile responsive design, adjusting the size and animation positions.
- -> setting the bg and fixing it to the container
- -> getting febnce to not move with bg changes
- -> understanding template rendering

## What I learned
- -> position:aabsolute fixes itself wrt the nearest container having pos attribute
- -> use dvh inplace of vh to adjust to the dynamic viewport(subtracts the tabs bar and task bar dimensions and adjusts)
- -> Even states can be rendered with UI and data.Need to clarify further
- -> In css for responsiveness code in decending order of dimensions coz the last one stays.
