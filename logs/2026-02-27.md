**Progress:**
-> Today it was a rather boring day.
-> Took work from home, so i was difficult to stay focussed and do the work. But i still took a course on GSAP and understood the basics.
-> Started work on wed7 template, Fixed navbar.

**Blockers:**
->Lack of energy and motivation

**Learnings:**
-> Animations are made very easy with GSAP
-> line height needs to be little bigger than the font size for some fonts else they will be clipped.
