**Progress:**
-> Shared footer and pop up modal with animations
-----Tomorrow-----
-> Need to solve graphics issue in my laptop
-> Figure out why the closing animation is not upto the mark

**Blockers:**
-> Had to create custom dropdown
-> Font style conflicting due to ttf file
-> Laptop jitters and glitching
	-> Possible causes: Overheating,graphics driver gone stale
-> Had to attend New Relic session on Kubernetes

**Learnings:**
-> Gemini can understand and code up figma files better with right prompts
-> Use variable font ttf file to avoid problems
-> Win+Ctrl+shift+B is for refresging the graphics driver without restarting
-> Kubernetes basics, I have a lot learn and have to take everyday study
